# Velness

A conversational AI project exploring mood tracking, reflective journaling, and CBT-inspired exercises using modern LLM tooling.

> This project is **not a medical product** and does not provide diagnosis, therapy, or crisis support.  
> It is an experimental software project focused on human-computer interaction and behavioral self-reflection tools.

## Vision

> *"Empowering minds through AI-driven mental wellness – where technology meets compassion."*

Velness represents the future of mental health support, seamlessly blending cutting-edge artificial intelligence with evidence-based therapeutic practices. Designed for proactive emotional maintenance and intelligent crisis intervention, our platform transforms how individuals engage with their mental well-being.

## Purpose

Most mental wellness apps either:

- track data but don’t talk to you
- or talk to you but don’t remember anything meaningful

Velness prototypes a middle ground:  
a personal conversational interface that helps users notice patterns in thoughts, habits, and emotions over time.

The focus is behavioral awareness, not treatment.

---

## Current Status

⚠️ Active development project

Features are experimental and subject to change.  
Expect incomplete flows, placeholder logic, and evolving architecture.

---

## Core Features

| Feature | What it actually does |
|------|------|
| Conversational Companion | Natural language chat interface for reflection and journaling prompts |
| Mood Tracking | Stores daily mood entries and simple trends |
| Pattern Insights | Detects recurring keywords, topics, and emotional tone changes |
| CBT-Inspired Exercises | Structured reflection prompts based on cognitive restructuring principles (non-clinical) |

---

## Technology Stack

- React + Vite frontend
- Node.js backend
- TypeScript
- LLM powered conversation layer
- Local data storage (session-based memory)

---

## What This Project Is

- A learning project
- An HCI + AI experimentation sandbox
- A behavioral journaling assistant
- A portfolio-grade full-stack AI application

## What This Project Is NOT

- A therapist
- A diagnosis system
- A crisis intervention service
- A replacement for professional help

---

## Planned Improvements

- Long-term memory summarization
- Better prompt engineering for reflections
- Habit correlation detection
- Privacy-first storage architecture
- Response quality evaluation dataset

---

## Why This Exists

Modern LLMs are good at conversation but bad at continuity.  
Mental wellness tools need continuity more than intelligence.

This project experiments with combining:

conversation + memory + pattern tracking

to see whether software can help users notice their own behavioral patterns earlier.
